Please review the code , it is complete working code except that I have removed the API KEY because it was sensitive information.
I have used the best practices. As the code was totally oriented on the API integration so there was not much work to optimize code or anything else.
The functionality is working fine as i am sharing the screencast video link which shows my functionality.
