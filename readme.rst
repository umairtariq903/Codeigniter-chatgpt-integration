I have updated the code . Things I have completed.

Cleaned code(formatted and removed extra comments)
Added error handling and logging(you can view the logs working in video)
Add unit test(you can check the unit test result in video)
Solid Principles(unit test controller has responsibility for only performing unit tests Fulfilling Single Responsibilty Principle)
